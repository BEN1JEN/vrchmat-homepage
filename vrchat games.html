<h2 id="freeze-tag-">Freeze Tag:</h2>
<p>There are two types of players in this game: players and runners.
Runners spawn randomly around the edge of the map, taggers who spawn in the center.
Taggers chase runners and freeze them by tagging them. Other runners can unfreeze people by tagging them.
If all runners are frozen (even with the thaw timer), the game ends and the tagger wins.
If the game timer runs out, the game ends and the runners win.</p>
<h3 id="settings-">Settings:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tagger Count</strong>: Number of players freezing players. Recommended setting: 1 for small groups (less then 6 people) 2 for big groups</li>
<li><strong>Game Timer</strong>: Time until the tagger looses the game if anyone is still unfrozen. Recommended setting: 5 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Thaw Timer</strong>: Automatically unfreeze players after this period of time. Disable by setting to zero. Recommended setting: 0</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="laser-tag-">Laser Tag:</h2>
<p>Each player has a laser gun that they can use to tag other players.
Getting shot temporarily disables your weapon.
In timed mode, shooting someone gives a point to your team.
In team life mode, getting shot takes a point away from your team.
If your team runs out of points (life), your team is out of the game and all players on the team become spectators.
In timed mode the team with the most points at the end of the game wins.
In team life mode the last team in the game wins.</p>
<h3 id="settings-">Settings:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Game Mode</strong>: Either timed mode or team life mode. Recommended setting: Timed Mode</li>
<li><strong>Game Timer</strong>: Time until the end of the game. Only applicable in timed mode. Recommended setting: 5 minutes</li>
<li><strong>Starting Points</strong>: Points each team starts with. Only applicable in team life mode. Recommended setting: 15 points</li>
<li><strong>Team Count</strong>: Number of teams. FFA mode makes everyone have their own team. Automatically randomly rounds. Recommended setting: 2</li>
<li><strong>Friendly Fire</strong>: Whether a player can accidentally shoot another player on the same team. Recommended setting: No</li>
<li><strong>Disable Time</strong>: Time until a tagged player&#39;s gun is re-enabled. Recommended setting: 5 seconds</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tag-">Tag:</h2>
<p>There are a number of taggers, each tagger must tag someone else to transfer tagership to them.
If they fail to tag someone before their timer runs out, they are out of the game and another random player becomes the tagger.
There are no tag-backs, so after becoming tagger there is a 15-second cooldown before the new tagger can tag the old tagger.
Every time someone is tagged the tagger timer starts for them, and is decreased from the timer the person that tagged them had by a number of seconds.
Last person in the game wins.</p>

Every zombie must chase and tag other players to turn them into zombies.

<h2 id="murder-mystery-">Murder Mystery:</h2>
<p>Players spawn randomly throughout the map, except the detectives who spawn in the center room.
The detective spawns with a gun with one bullet, and can get additional bullets by collecting coins that spawn throughout the map
The innocents can collect coins and trade them in for magic potions, or an additional gun.
The murderers do not see coins and can not collect them.
After a fixed amount of time the murderers will receive their weapon, a knife.
They can throw the knife but they will need to pick it up again as there is only one knife per murderer.
The murderers must kill all innocents (note that they need not kill the detectives, although it is recommended).
They must do this before the time runs out and without getting shot by the detectives to win the game.
If the time runs out or all the murderers are dead and there are still innocents alive, the innocents and detectives win the game.</p>
